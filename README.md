## Minesweeper
A retro looking Minesweeper with a custom sidebar menu that features a how to play section and customizable game settings written with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Future Plans
As of the moment the site is best viewed on a desktop/laptop using the Chrome browser, support for most browsers and devices will come over time.
